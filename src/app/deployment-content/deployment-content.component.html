        <p>
          By combining wireless communication with real-time information exchange and global positioning, Service-Link enables utilities
          to streamline and automate many of the processes associated with field service. The result is improved mobile workforce
          performance at a lower operating cost. For the typical utility company, two-thirds of employees are field-based.
          This makes the automation of field personnel and the extension of critical business applications to remote users
          a key opportunity for productivity improvement and cost reduction.
