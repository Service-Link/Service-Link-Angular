            By combining wireless communication with real-time information exchange and global positioning, Service-Link enables utilities
            to streamline and automate many of the processes associated with field service. The result is improved mobile workforce
            performance at a lower operating cost. For the typical utility company, two-thirds of employees are field-based.
            This makes the automation of field personnel and the extension of critical business applications to remote users
            a key opportunity for productivity improvement and cost reduction. Our primary market is the United States with some
            presence in Canada and the Caribbean. We have excellent relationships with our customers, which serve as strong references
            for our product and company:
